## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_hyperflex_hxap_datacenter.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `identity`:(string) Internally generated identity of this datacenter. This entity is not manipulated by users. It aids in uniquely identifying the datacenter object. For VMware, this is a MOR (managed object reference).
