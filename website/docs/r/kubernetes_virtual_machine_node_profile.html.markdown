# Resource: intersight_kubernetes_virtual_machine_node_profile
A profile specifying configuration settings for a Virtual Machine node. It is auto-generated based on the NodeGroupProfile and VirtualMachineNodePolicy configuration. Users can do operations like Drain, Cordon, Rebuild on a node.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `action`:(string) User initiated action. Each profile type has its own supported actions. For HyperFlex cluster profile, the supported actions are -- Validate, Deploy, Continue, Retry, Abort, Unassign For server profile, the support actions are -- Deploy, Unassign. 
* `cloud_provider`:(string) Cloud provider for this node profile.* `noProvider` - Enables the use of no cloud provider.* `external` - Out of tree cloud provider, e.g. CPI for vsphere. 
* `config_context`:(HashMap) - The configuration state and results of the last configuration operation. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `config_state`:(string)(Computed) Indicates a profile's configuration deploying state. Values -- Assigned, Not-assigned, Associated, Pending-changes, Out-of-sync, Validating, Configuring, Failed. 
  + `control_action`:(string) System action to trigger the appropriate workflow. Values -- No_op, ConfigChange, Deploy, Unbind. 
  + `error_state`:(string) Indicates a profile's error state. Values -- Validation-error (Static validation error), Pre-config-error (Runtime validation error), Config-error (Runtime configuration error). 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `oper_state`:(string)(Computed) Combined state (configState, and operational state of the associated physical resource) to indicate the current state of the profile. Values -- n/a, Power-off, Pending-changes, Configuring, Ok, Failed. 
* `config_result`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a kubernetesConfigResult resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the profile. 
* `ip_addresses`:(Array) An array of relationships to ippoolIpLease resources.
