# Resource: intersight_fabric_uplink_pc_role
Object sent by user to configure a ethernet uplink port-channel on the collection of ports.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `admin_speed`:(string) Admin configured speed for the port.* `Auto` - Admin configurable speed AUTO ( default ).* `1Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 1Gbps.* `10Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 10Gbps.* `25Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 25Gbps.* `40Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 40Gbps.* `100Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 100Gbps. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `pc_id`:(int) Unique Identifier of the port-channel, local to this switch. 
* `port_policy`:(HashMap) - A reference to a fabricPortPolicy resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `ports`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the aggregatePortId is set to 0, and unused.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'aggregatePortId' port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `port_id`:(int) Port Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the portId is the port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch, FEX or chassis.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'portId' represents the port id on the fanout side of the breakout cable. 
  + `slot_id`:(int) Slot Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `udld_admin_state`:(string) Admin configured state for UDLD for this port.* `Disabled` - Admin configured Disabled State.* `Enabled` - Admin configured Enabled State.
