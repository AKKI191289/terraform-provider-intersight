# Resource: intersight_comm_http_proxy_policy
A policy specifying the HTTP proxy settings to be used by the HyperFlex installation process and HyperFlex storage controller VMs. This policy is required when the internet access of your servers including CIMC and HyperFlex storage controller VMs is secured by a HTTP proxy.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:

  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy.
