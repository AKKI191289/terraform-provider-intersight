# Resource: intersight_certificatemanagement_policy
Certificate Management policy models a reusable certificate and private key configuration that can be applied to multiple servers via profile association.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `certificates`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `certificate`:(HashMap) - Certificate that is used for verifying the authorization. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `issuer`:(HashMap) -(Computed) The X.509 distinguished name of the issuer of this certificate. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `common_name`:(string)(Computed) A required component that identifies a person or an object. 
    + `country`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `locality`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
    + `organization`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `organizational_unit`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `state`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `pem_certificate`:(string) The base64 encoded certificate in PEM format. 
  + `sha256_fingerprint`:(string)(Computed) The computed SHA-256 fingerprint of the certificate. Equivalent to 'openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256'. 
  + `signature_algorithm`:(string)(Computed) Signature algorithm, as specified in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). 
  + `subject`:(HashMap) -(Computed) The X.509 distinguished name of the subject of this certificate. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `common_name`:(string)(Computed) A required component that identifies a person or an object. 
    + `country`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `locality`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
    + `organization`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `organizational_unit`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `state`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
  + `enabled`:(bool) Enable/Disable the certificate in Certificate Management policy. 
  + `is_privatekey_set`:(bool)(Computed) Indicates whether the value of the 'privatekey' property has been set. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `privatekey`:(string) Private Key which is used to validate the certificate. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
